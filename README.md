# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

This is a simple weather application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to search for weather data by city name using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. The app fetches weather data like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description, and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features

- üåç **Search Weather by City**: Enter any city's name to get the current weather.
- üå°Ô∏è **Temperature**: Displays temperature in Celsius.
- üí® **Humidity & Wind**: Shows humidity percentage and wind speed.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Weather Description**: Displays a short description of the weather (e.g., clear sky, rainy).
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è **Go Back Button**: Allows users to return to the search input after checking the weather.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For creating the structure of the app.
- **CSS3**: For styling the app and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For handling logic, making API requests, and updating the DOM.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: To fetch real-time weather data for any city.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the app.

## API Key

To use the app, you need an API key from OpenWeatherMap:

1. Sign up for an API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
2. Replace the `apiKey` variable in the JavaScript file with your own API key:
    ```js
    const apiKey = 'your-api-key-here';
    ```
